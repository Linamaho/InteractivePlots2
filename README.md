## An interactive plot made with Plotly

After the analysis of the dataset for clinical trials from 1984 to 2020, I created a plot for the number of enrollments in clinical trials with time. 
To make it more convenient, I added a range slider to select a specific time period and some buttons at the top for an easy selection of months or years.
